This is the admin dashboard interface for the cookwork project.

To start in development mode, run `npm start` in the project folder and start the backend api in development mode using `npm run dev` in the backend project's folder.

To run the app in production, create an optimized production build with `npm run build` and start the static server with `node server` (or `pm2 start frontend`)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!



This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), therefore the info from create-react-app-README.md applies as well.
